# flask_with_db
Simple Flask App w/ Postgres Database deployed using Docker.
The goal of this was just to establish an application with some components so I can use this to work on more infrastructure projects in the future. 

To build, simply clone the repo and run "docker compose up" and it should work. 
Access the page at http://localhost/ and access the dbadmin page going to http://localhost:8080 

You will need to add the database if you wish to view in the admin page, the credentials can be set/found in the database.cfg file.
